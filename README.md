## Face Recognition based Attendance System

This project will help eliminate the traditional attendance system, minimize manipulation during attendance and record the arrival time of the students. It is also very easy to use and manage. The proposed system will reduce the paperwork where attendance will no longer involve any manual recording. The new system will also reduce the total time needed to do attendance recording. The new system will acquire individual attendance by means of facial recognition to secure data accuracy of the attendance.
